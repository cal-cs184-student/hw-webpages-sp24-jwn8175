            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this project we created a program that simulates the physical
                movements of a piece of cloth. In order to make the simulation
                realistic, we modeled the forces acting on the cloth to
                determine how its position changed over time, and how collisions
                would affect its position. After implementing the physics
                simulator, we also implementing various shader programs in order
                to create images with different shaders applied.
            </p>

            <h2>Part 1: Masses and Springs</h2>
            <p>
                In order to build the grid of masses and springs, we used the
                following two formulas to determine the distance between each of
                the point masses:
                <code>width_increment = width / (num_width_points - 1.0)</code>
                and
                <code
                    >double height_increment = height / (num_height_points -
                    1.0)</code
                >. For vertically oriented point masses, we generated the random
                offset for the z-position with the following:
                <code
                    >double offset = ((double)rand() / RAND_MAX * 2.0 - 1.0) *
                    0.001</code
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we added the point masses into the array in row-major
                order, in order to retrieve the point mass at position \((i,
                j)\) we simply index the position
                <code>point_masses.at(j * num_width_points + i)</code>. This
                allowed us to locate the required neighbors for each point mass
                and create the springs between them.

            <h2>Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
            <p>
                For each time step, we compute the total force acting on each
                point mass before using Verlet integration to compute the new
                positions of each point mass. Then we implemented an additional
                feature based on the SIGGRAPH 1995 Provot paper in order to
                constrain the position update of each point mass.

                Below are a few images of the cloth falling with varying
                <code>ks</code> values. With a low ks value, the cloth appears
                more slacking between the two pinned point masses, with some
                creases along the edge. In contrast, with a high ks value, the
                cloth between the two pinned point masses appears more taut and
                less flexible.

                Below are a few images of the cloth falling with varying density
                values. With a low density value, the behavior of the cloth
                resembles that of when there is a high <code>ks</code> value:
                more taut. This is likely due to the lower mass making external
                forces have less of an impact. With a high density value, the
                cloth exhibits the opposite behavior, with more slack between
                the two pinned point masses.

                With a low damping value, the cloth falls and settles faster.
                Notably, when the damping is at 0%, the cloth does not settle;
                instead it swings back and forth chaotically. With a high
                damping value, the cloth falls and settles like the default, but
                at a much slower rate. Below is an image of the cloth in

            <h2>Part 3: Handling Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
            <p>
                In order to implement sphere collisions, we first checked to see
                whether the passed in point mass was inside or exactly on the
                sphere. We did this by checking if the distance between the
                point mass and sphere's origin was less than or equal to the
                sphere's radius. If the point mass was inside the sphere, we
                extended the vector between the point mass and sphere's origin
                in order to find the point at which it would have intersected
                the sphere's surface. In order to derive this intersection
                point, we obtained the vector between the point mass's position
                and sphere's origin, calculated the magnitude of this vector,
                scaled this vector by the sphere's radius over the vector's
                magnitude, and then added this scaled vector to the coordinates
                of the sphere's origin. We called this intersection point the
                tangent point. If the point mass was exactly on the surface of
                the sphere, we set the tangent point to the point mass's
                position. Next, for both of these cases, we calculated the
                correction vector by subtracting the point mass's last position
                from the tangent point. And finally, we updated the point mass's
                position by scaling the correction vector by 1 - friction and
                adding this scaled vector to the point mass's last position.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to implement plane collisions, we first checked whether
                the passed in point mass's last position and current position
                were on different sides of the plane. In order to do this, we
                used the plane's normal and point values to represent the plane
                as an equation in point-normal form. Then we plugged in the
                point mass's last position and position coordinates into the
                plane equation and checked if the signs of the two resulting
                values were opposite of each other. If they were, that meant
                that they were on opposite sides of the plane and that there was
                a collision. If there was a collision, we then calculated the
                tangent point by finding the distance between the point mass and
                the plane and subtracting this distance from the point mass's
                position. Then we derived the correction vector by subtracting
                the point mass's last position from the tangent point and adding
                a small offset called the surface offset. And finally, we
                updated the point mass's position by scaling the correction
                vector by 1 - friction and adding this scaled vector to the
                point mass's last position.

                As the <code>ks</code> value is increased from 500 N/m to 5000
                N/m (the default) to 50,000 N/m, the cloth becomes less and less
                draped over the sphere. While the cloth still comes to rest on
                the sphere for all three simulations, the 500 N/m cloth has more
                wrinkles along the side and comes to rest in a more vertical
                position. In contrast, the sides of the 50,000 N/m cloth seems
                more “floaty” around the edges and less vertical
            </p>

                We did not notice any difference in how the cloth falls on
                itself when varying the density and <code>ks</code>, in terms of
                fall speed and shape. However, the cloth did seem to settle in a
                final resting state much faster at the higher density and
                <code>ks</code> value, whereas when the values were lower, it
                fell more on itself and “wriggled” around on the plane before
                finally settling.

            <h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
            <p>
                Our shader program runs in parallel in the GPU, which speeds up
                computation greatly in order to support real-time rendering. The
                shader program consists of two parts: a vertex shader and a
                fragment shader. The vertex shader computes and sets geometric
                properties of vertices, such as their position in the world and
                normal. After these values are computed, they get passed on to
                the fragment shader, which uses these geometric properties to
                compute the color that is seen by the camera based on what
                shading technique we want.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blinn-Phong shading combines three types of light to create one
                color: the ambient light, diffuse reflection, and specular
                reflection components. This allows the final output to have more
                natural-looking lighting, since the diffuse reflection of rough
                surfaces and the specular reflection of shiny surfaces are both
                accounted for. Below are some sample images that demonstrate
                this.

                Below are images rendered with bump and displacement shading,
                using texture_3.png. Comparing the two shaders, the sphere in
                bump shading appears smoother than the one in displacement
                shading. The sphere with displacement shading looks a lot more
                rugged and deformed.

                When changing the coarseness of the sphere, there seems to not
                be much of a difference in the output with the bump shader.
                However, the displacement shader has some very different
                results. With <code>-o 16 -a 16</code>, the sphere isn't even
                very round anymore. With <code>-o 128 -a 128</code>, the sphere
                resembles the result in the previous section.
